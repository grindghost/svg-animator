▢ Clean temp animations in a more robut manner (on each click).
▢ Remove temp style when user click inside the svg preview zone (just outside).
▢ Add label next to display bounding box options (to make it more clear).

▢ Remove the temp animation if the user click outside the svg.
▢ Don't allow to manipulate the first/root element (block it).
▢ Save project with ctrl+s.
▢ Display the applied animation as small "tag" button in a container above the svg-preview zone. Each button should contain the name of the animation and a small X, that would allow to delete/remove it from there. Doing so, it should update the "Applied Animations" content also to reflect the removals. I had a crazy idea... Could we allow the user to re-order them? Doing so we would need to re-arrange all the anim-wrapper that wrap the elements so their nesting reflect the order of the animations.

▢ Support to hide animations/shapes.
▢ Support to ree-order multiple anmation (via an index).
