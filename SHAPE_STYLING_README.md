# Shape Styling Controls

This document describes the new shape styling controls that have been added to SVG Animator Pro.

## Overview

When you select a shape in the SVG viewer, a new "Shape Styling" panel appears above the animation controls. This panel allows you to modify the visual properties of the selected shape in real-time.

## Features

### Fill Color Controls
- **Color Picker**: Click to select a fill color from the color palette
- **Opacity Slider**: Adjust the transparency of the fill color (0-100%)
- **Real-time Preview**: Changes are applied immediately to the selected shape

### Stroke Color Controls
- **Color Picker**: Click to select a stroke (outline) color from the color palette
- **Opacity Slider**: Adjust the transparency of the stroke color (0-100%)
- **Real-time Preview**: Changes are applied immediately to the selected shape

### Stroke Width Control
- **Width Slider**: Adjust the thickness of the stroke (0-20px)
- **Real-time Preview**: Changes are applied immediately to the selected shape

## How to Use

1. **Upload an SVG file** or drag and drop one into the viewer
2. **Click on any shape** in the SVG to select it
3. **The Shape Styling panel will appear** above the animation controls
4. **Adjust the controls** to modify the shape's appearance:
   - Use the color pickers to change colors
   - Use the opacity sliders to adjust transparency
   - Use the stroke width slider to change line thickness
5. **All changes are applied in real-time** as you adjust the controls

## Technical Details

### Color Format
- Colors are stored internally as RGBA values for maximum flexibility
- The color pickers use hex format for user-friendly color selection
- Opacity values range from 0 (transparent) to 100 (opaque)

### Stroke Handling
- When stroke width is set to 0, the stroke is automatically set to 'none'
- When opacity is set to 0, the fill/stroke is automatically set to 'none'
- The system automatically converts between different color formats

### Element Selection
- The styling controls only appear when a shape is selected
- The controls automatically update to reflect the current shape's properties
- When no shape is selected, the styling panel is hidden

## Supported SVG Elements

The styling controls work with all standard SVG elements including:
- `<rect>` (rectangles)
- `<circle>` (circles)
- `<ellipse>` (ellipses)
- `<line>` (lines)
- `<polygon>` (polygons)
- `<path>` (paths)
- `<text>` (text elements)
- And more...

## Browser Compatibility

The styling controls use modern web standards and are compatible with:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Troubleshooting

### Controls Not Appearing
- Make sure you have selected a shape by clicking on it
- Check that the SVG file has been loaded successfully
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

### Changes Not Applying
- Verify that the shape is still selected (should have blue handles around it)
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Try refreshing the page and reloading the SVG

### Color Issues
- The color pickers default to black (#000000) if no color is detected
- Opacity sliders default to 100% if no opacity is detected
- Stroke width defaults to 1px if no width is detected

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Color palette presets
- Gradient fill support
- Pattern fill support
- Stroke dash patterns
- Layer management
- Style presets and themes
